Program to compute Affine/Helmert 2D transformation parameters.

Ported from C to TS by li0ard

**ATTENTION: This program is only compatible with [Bun](https://bun.sh)**

### Usage

```
findkey_ts --f1 <coord1> --f2 <coord2>
```

### Input files

For the program to work, 2 files are needed: a file with coordinates in the original coordinate system and a file with coordinates in the desired coordinate system (6-7 pairs of coordinates are needed for the best result)

 Coordinate pairs are written in the `Y X` format
